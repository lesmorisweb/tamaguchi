## Overview

The first step is register a account whit a user name, a pet name, choose the color of the dinosaur and a password. Then, when you submit the register, open the login and when you enter in your acount the app start on the screen.

You can interact whit your pet in diferent forms, like jump when you click them, gif the food and play tiktaktoe multiplayer or singleplayer.

If you don't atend your pet, it can dead if the hungry level reaches 0. Your per going to be older and eventually your pet can dead for old.

## My Process

I start with the front end part, organice
from the interior component to the exterior of each one of the parts that contain the scenario.

The entire process of analysis and functional development of the application is done on screen, who distributes the information to the components that require it.

all data to need actualice are on custom hooks. And the backend are the final part of the process with sequalize.
To do the merge of the banches I need to change the original folder of the proyect form a new folder becouse that a lot conflicts betwen the changes form the banches.

### Continued development

In the finall part of the proyect the backend don't work and with a too shot time to sent the proyect I prefer do it with local storage. I want continue work in this proyect since it is a very large project and although I liked the result, I would like to be able to expand it, improve it and finish it completely
